# Agri-Finance Credit Risk Modeling

This project was developed during my data science internship at Agriculture Finance Services Corporation (AFSC) in the summer of 2024. The project focuses on building data-driven solutions to improve credit risk management in the agricultural finance sector. My role as project manager involved leading a team of interns to investigate how AI and machine learning can reduce financial risk for lending services in agriculture.

## Project Overview
Agricultural finance (agri-finance) deals with unique challenges like weather dependency, seasonal income, and other agricultural factors, which traditional finance models struggle to address. This project aimed to improve credit risk modeling in agri-finance by developing predictive machine learning models.

## Objectives
1. **Identify Key Factors**: Discover the main causes of loan defaults.
2. **Forecast Loan Defaults**: Predict which loans are likely to default.
3. **Improve Predictive Accuracy**: Use resampling techniques and explainable AI (XAI) to enhance model performance.
4. **Visualize and Report Insights**: Create actionable dashboards using Power BI to communicate findings.

## Methodology
- **Data Collection**: Gathered data from internal and external sources.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and transformed data, including using clustering techniques to handle missing data.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Developed models like decision trees, random forests, and XGBoost, achieving a 97.5% accuracy in predicting loan defaults.
- **Advanced Techniques**: Applied data resampling and XAI methods for model optimization and explainability.
- **Power BI Dashboards**: Created dashboards for both internal and external stakeholders to monitor credit risk.

## Key Results
- Improved default loan detection by 6.5%.
- Identified four critical factors influencing loan defaults, such as accrued interest and total amount due.
- Potential to reduce credit risk exposure by 4.4%, translating to $12 million in potential financial loss savings.

## Business Implications
While the model is highly accurate, only 10% of predicted default loans can realistically be prevented from defaulting. Nonetheless, this project highlights the potential of AI to optimize risk management in agricultural finance, offering tangible financial benefits.
