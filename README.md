## Project Overview:
* This project was developed during my data science internship at Agriculture Finance Services Corporation (AFSC) in summer 2024.
* I was also a project manager and led a team of 4 interns (Seth Graham, Kiana Mailloux, Lesley Brausse, and myself) for a project (which isthis project!) that investigates the impact of data can bring to the company.

## Project Problem:
* Agricultural finance (agri-finance) deals with unique challenges like weather dependency, seasonal income, and other agricultural factors, which traditional finance models struggle to address. 
* This project aimed to improve credit risk modeling for AFSC by developing predictive machine learning models tailored for the agri-finance sector.

## Project Objectives:
1. **Identify Key Factors**: Discover the main causes of loan defaults.
2. **Forecast Loan Defaults**: Predict which loans are likely to default in the future.
3. **Improve Predictive Accuracy**: Use data resampling techniques and explainable AI (XAI) to enhance model performance.
4. **Visualize and Report Insights**: Create interactive Power BI dashboards to communicate actionable insights extracted from findings.

## Project Steps:
1. **Data Collection**: Gathered data from internal and external data sources with SAS and SQL.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned, imputed, and transformed data for future analytical and prediction purposses. Adopted an unsupervised learning approach by using clustering techniques to impute some missing data.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzed data to observe any hidden key trends, patterns, and relationship in the dataset.
4. **Feature Engineering**: Created new features from existing data to further improve the performances of machine learning models built later.
5. **Building Machine Learning Models**: Developed AI predictive models like decision trees, random forests, extreme gradient boosting trees (XGBoost), and extreme gradient boosting random forest (XGBRF)
6. **Model Optimization** Built semi-automated pipeline to tune the built models for best predictive performances with optimal hyperparameters.
7. **Exploring Advanced Techniques**: Applied data resampling techniques and explainable AI (XAI) methods for model optimization and explainability.
8. **Power BI Dashboards**: Created dashboards for both internal and external stakeholders to present actionable insights obtained.

## Key Results
1. Identified four critical factors influencing loan defaults (accrued interest, arrear interest, total amount due, proportion of remaining payment)
2. Achieving a 97.5% accuracy in predicting loan defaults (correctly forecast 975 loans' default outcome out of 1000!)
3. Improved anomaly (default loans) detection by 6.5% with data resampling techniques.
4. Produced interpretable and credible AI solutions with explainable AI methods.
5. Communicate findings in various methods (presentations, Power BI dashboards, and an internal business research report).

## Business Implications:
* By applying the following assumpetions:
   * The optimized models can retain their predcitive accuracy in forecasting the default outcomes of new loans.
   * Only 10% of predicted default loans can realistically be prevented from defaulting with our model.
* If the project built models are applied to forecast all loans for AFSC in the fiscal year of 2023, then:
    * 4.4% of credit risk exposed are reduced.
    * translating to $12 million in potential financial loss savings.
